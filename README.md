# Some-experiments-with-CNN

Four experiments of a simple convolutional neural net with mnist data set:

1) random scaling and random location

2) random scaling and random location with gaussian noise

3) random scaling and random location and permuting

4) random scaling and random location and permuting with gaussian noise

loss and accuracy during the training process of these experiments are in "loss and accuracy" folder
